From the 203 countries with data on GDP per capita, the mean is $20345.71. The GDP per capita between different countries vary greatly, with the maximum being $240862.18 and the minimum being $259.03\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=2}\n```\ncount       203.000000\nmean      20345.707649\nstd       31308.942225\nmin         259.025031\n25%        2570.563284\n50%        7587.588173\n75%       25982.630050\nmax      240862.182448\nName: gdp_per_capita, dtype: float64\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Inflation Rate\nThe inflation rate in a country is the increase in prices over a given period of time [@oner_inflation]. The average inflation rate in th 169 observed countries is 12.5%. Some countries have an inflation rate in the negatives, with the minimum value in this dataset being -6.69%\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=3}\n```\ncount    169.000000\nmean      12.493936\nstd       19.682433\nmin       -6.687321\n25%        5.518129\n50%        7.967574\n75%       11.665567\nmax      171.205491\nName: inflation_rate, dtype: float64\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Measles Immunization Rates\nMeasles is an extremely deadly disease that has affected many nations for centuries. The rate at which the populations in a country are vaccinated for measles is greatly important to the overall health of the population. From the observed 193 countries, the average measles vaccination rate is 83.85%.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=4}\n```\ncount    193.000000\nmean      83.854922\nstd       15.996083\nmin        0.000000\n25%       76.000000\n50%       90.000000\n75%       96.000000\nmax       99.000000\nName: measles_immunisation_rate, dtype: float64\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# GDP Growth Rate\nThe GDP growth rate measures how fast a country's economy is growing / shrinking each year. This visualization compares a country's growth rate and it's GDP per capita in the year 2022. From the graph, it appears that many of the countries that have higher GDPs do not have either a high or low GDP growth rate.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=5}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](assignment_05_files/figure-pdf/cell-6-output-1.pdf){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFigure 1: a bar chart showing the GDP Growth Rate vs GDP per Capita.

According to the data, countries that have a higher percentage of their population vaccinated for measles, the average life expectancy is higher.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=6}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](assignment_05_files/figure-pdf/cell-7-output-1.pdf){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFigure 2: a scatter plot showing the Measles Immunization rate vs Life Expectancy.
